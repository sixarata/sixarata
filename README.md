## why

We love games.

We love games that appear simple, but are exquisitely robust and easily enjoyed by all audiences without barriers.

We love sharing, learning, teaching, experimenting, and believe deeply in the freedom to do these things freely forever.

We believe JavaScript and the Web are currently the best open stack of technologies to work with.
