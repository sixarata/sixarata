## why

We love games.
Games that appear simple, but are exquisitely robust and easily enjoyed by all audiences, without barriers.
Sharing, learning, teaching, experimenting, and the freedom to do them freely forever.
JavaScript (and the Web) are currently the simplest & most accessible to the widest audience.
