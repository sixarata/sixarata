* Enable everyone to see their name in the credits of an iconic video game.
* Provide open source versions of every cool platform game mechanic that has made you think differently about the world.
* A million project forks, recommending changes back into it, forging a monolithic platforming masterpiece & encyclopedia.
* Share the success of these achievements with the entire world.

## why

We love games.
Games that start simple but are exquisitely robust and easily enjoyed by all audiences without barriers.
Sharing, learning, teaching, experimenting, and the freedom to do these things freely forever.
JavaScript (and the Web) are currently the simplest & most accessible to the widest audience.

## what

"sixarata" backwards is "ataraxis": the absence of mental stress or anxiety.
The best games balance thrills with chills, and that is a design priority in this project.
